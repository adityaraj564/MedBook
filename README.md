## Features

### Level 1: User Authentication
- **Landing Screen**: Users can choose to sign up or log in.
- **Signup Screen**: Allows new users to register using an email, password, and country selection.
  - **Country Selection**: Uses an external API to populate a country picker.
  - **Email and Password Validation**: Validates email format and password strength.
- **Login Screen**: Allows returning users to log in using stored credentials.

### Level 2: Book Search and Sort
- **Search for Books**: Users can search for books by title, with results displayed in a table view.
- **Pagination and Sorting**: Results can be paginated and sorted by title, rating, or popularity.

### Level 3: Bookmarking
- **Bookmark Feature**: Users can bookmark/unbookmark books, with bookmarked items stored locally.
- **Bookmarked Screen**: A separate screen to view all bookmarked books.

## Architecture

MedBook is built using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture pattern, which separates the data handling, UI logic, and view representation, providing a scalable and maintainable codebase.

### Key Components
- **Model**: Defines data structures (e.g., `User`, `Book`, `Country`).
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic, data transformations, and communicates with views (e.g., `SignupViewModel`, `HomeViewModel`).
- **View**: User interface elements, interacting with view models to display data and handle user input (e.g., `HomeViewController`, `SignupViewController`).
- **Services**: Manages API requests and local data storage (e.g., `APIService`, `LocalStorage`).

## Requirements
- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Swift 5
